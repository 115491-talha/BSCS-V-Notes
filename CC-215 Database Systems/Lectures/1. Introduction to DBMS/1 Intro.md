## **2. Real-Life Analogy: Pencil Manufacturing Company**

* Imagine a company that manufactures pencils.
* Each pencil has details like:

  * **Length**
  * **Color**
  * **Price**
  * **Barcode**
  * **Batch Number**
  * **Manufacturing Date**

📘 **Purpose:**
To highlight that **every small detail (data)** matters for the company’s accountability and decision-making.

## **3. Why Data Matters**

* **Data outlives the system** — even if the machine or software fails, data should be safe.
* **Helps in customer service:**
  Example — If a customer complains about a defective pencil, the company can check the batch records.
* **Improves product quality:**
  Data analysis reveals trends or flaws in production.

💡 **Real-Life Example:**
If you order a product online and report an issue, the company checks its **database records** to verify the order, shipment, and batch details.
